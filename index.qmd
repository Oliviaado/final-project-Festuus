# Introduction

The Osprey (Pandion haliaetus) is a partial migratory bird species with a broad distribution across North America. Partial migration means that not all populations migrate, and the extent of migration depends on geographical location and environmental conditions. Ospreys breeding in northern latitudes (e.g., Canada and the northern United States) are typically obligate migrants, traveling to Central and South America for the winter. Those in southern parts of the United States may be year-round residents, depending on food availability and climate.

Monitoring bird populations and migration patterns is vital for understanding ecological dynamics and informing conservation efforts. However, traditional monitoring approaches, such as field observations and curated datasets like eBird, are often resource-intensive and may leave gaps in spatial and temporal coverage. As such, there is a growing need to explore complementary data sources that can fill these gaps.

This project investigates the potential of social media as an alternative data source for ecological monitoring by focusing on the seasonal occurrences and geographical distribution of Ospreys across the United States. Using geotagged Flickr photos and comparing them to formal bird observation data from eBird, the study aims to assess the extent to which trends in the presence and migration patterns of Ospreys captured through social media align with patterns documented in citizen science databases. By highlighting the utility of photo-based social media data, this project seeks to advance our understanding of how platforms like Flickr can contribute to ecological and avian studies, offering a scalable and accessible tool for biodiversity monitoring.

# Materials and methods
#Datasets

The first step in the project is to download geotagged images of Ospreys from Flickr's public API. This involve querying the "Osprey" tag to identify relevant photos. The query is also restricted to a specific timeframe to facilitate the analysis of seasonal patterns. Metadata associated with the photos, including geographic coordinates, date, and time of posting, were collected. 

eBird data will be downloaded from the eBird data products website and processed in R. The occurrence and observation data will be accessed through eBird's data portal, specifically focusing on Osprey sightings across the U.S. The dataset will include key variables such as location, and, date (aligned to match the timeframe of Flickr photo requests). This standardized dataset will enable direct comparisons with the Flickr data for temporal and spatial analysis.

#Installing and loading libraries

#Retrieving Flickr Photos 

-     Set up your Flickr credentials (i.e Flickr key and secret)
-     Create a Flickr account to set up API key and secret
-     Request Flickr photo using the Flickr API through photosearcher library
-     Set up a bounding box to only extract data within the US
-     Set up minimum and maximum date (2000-2024, in this case)

```{r}
Osprey <- photo_search(
  mindate_taken = "2000-01-01",
  maxdate_taken = "2024-11-28", 
  text = "Osprey",
  tags = c("Osprey", "osprey"),
  bbox = c(-124.6813,25.12993,-67.00742,49.38323),
  has_geo = TRUE)
```

#Exploring Dataset

```{r, results='asis'}
Osprey %>% 
  slice(1:5) %>% 
  kable(digits=2,align="c")%>% 
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = 
                  c("striped", "hover", "condensed", "responsive"))
```

#Retrieving eBird Osprey Observations

See <https://science.ebird.org/en/use-ebird-data/download-ebird-data-products> to download eBird EBD data

-   Set path for the downloaded eBird data 
-   Import the eBird txt file

```{r, message = FALSE, warning=FALSE}
#auk_set_ebd_path(path = "path/to/eBird/data")

ebird <- read.delim("ebird_Osprey_Oct-2024.txt", sep = "\t",

  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = 
                  c("striped", "hover", "condensed", "responsive"))
```

# Results
The analysis of Flickr and eBird data reveals consistent trends in the seasonal distribution of Ospreys across the United States. Flickr photos indicate clear seasonal migration patterns, with Ospreys predominantly observed in northern states like New Jersey and Maryland during the summer months, followed by a shift to southern states such as Florida, California, Texas, Arizona, and North Carolina during the winter (Figure 2).

A closer examination of the winter distribution shows strong alignment between the two datasets. The top four states with the highest recorded Osprey occurrences during winter are identical in both Flickr and eBird data (Figure 3), highlighting a high level of correlation between the two sources. 

Flickr and eBird data exhibit consistent trends in the seasonal distribution of Ospreys across the United States, spanning spring, summer, fall, and winter (Figure 4).Furthermore, when comparing the top ten states where Ospreys are observed year-round, nine of these states match between Flickr and eBird datasets (Figure 5).

# Conclusions

The high degree of correlation between the two data sources, particularly in the top states for winter occurrences and year-round presence, highlights the reliability of photo-based citizen science data in reflecting species distribution patterns. These findings underscore the value of integrating alternative data sources like Flickr with traditional ecological datasets to enhance spatial and temporal coverage, offering a scalable approach to support conservation and monitoring efforts for migratory species like the Osprey.
